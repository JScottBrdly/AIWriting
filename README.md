# AIWriting
Editorial outputs of an application called Persona leveraging gpt, claude, and local LLM models.

# The Highlevel
This application is a AI-driven content creation and editorial tool built to generate articles with a tailored persona based on writer biography. Designed to infuse a specific voice and style into every piece, the tool harnesses multiple API-based language models—OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic's Claude, and local LLMs—through an agent-based architecture, where each handles distinct editorial and content-generation tasks. 

Its modular approach allows each API to contribute, from initial drafting to advanced editing, delivering an article that reflects the desired persona. By breaking text into manageable sections and systematically applying each AI’s capabilities, the application balances creativity, precision, and style. It sorta works.

# Article Output
The final editorial represents the full sequence. No "person" wrote these articles. You can see tradmarks of an AI in the writing style, despite the persona focus.
